## 🩺 Project Overview
`dicom-rx-tools` is a modular Python framework designed to streamline the manipulation, analysis, and integration of DICOM imaging data within radiology workflows. It aims to support academic, clinical, and research applications — with a clear roadmap towards AI integration, structured reporting (TNM, FIGO, O-RADS, LI-RADS, BI-RADS), and quantitative imaging.

This project serves as a foundational component for intelligent ecosystems such as **Röntgen**, targeting precision oncology staging, radiomics pipelines, and educational tools for radiology residents.
